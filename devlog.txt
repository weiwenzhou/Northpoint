  updated design.pdf with feedback from peer review
    1. Added additional features
    2. Address links vs story text on landing page
    3. Show the connections between database tables
    4. Change edit count to timestamp for double functionality on the front and backend 
       (Timestamp is more understandable than edit count).
    5. Updated site map to make it clearer.
