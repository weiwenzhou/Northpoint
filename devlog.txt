  updated design.pdf with feedback from peer review
    1. Added additional features
    2. Address links vs story text on landing page
    3. Show the connections between database tables
    4. Change edit count to timestamp for double functionality on the front and backend 
       (Timestamp is more understandable than edit count).
    5. Updated site map to make it clearer.

  1. Everyone should know, understand and agree on the every aspect of the design 
  regardless if you are working on that part or not. Communication is key.
  2. Develop incrementally rather than just putting together a bunch of code to just make it work
  3. Have files/functions/templates that do one thing very well instead of everything.
